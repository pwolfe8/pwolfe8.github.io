<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>At ConvexMind, our website (convexmind.io) is just for parents, while our apps are designed for the whole family, including young children with parent supervision. We take privacy seriously at ConvexMind and this policy is designed to share what information we collect and how we use it. We last updated the contents of this policy on August 21, 2018. ConvexMind may change or update the Privacy Policy at any time as we add new or different features, or as the law changes. Unless another date is given, the changes are effective upon posting. If we make a material change to this policy we will post notice here before making the change and if we have your parent email address we will contact you to tell you about the changes. Thus, you should review the Privacy Policy frequently. This Privacy Policy is also part of the Terms of Service that explain your rights and responsibilities and ConvexMind’s when using ConvexMind’s services and sites. If you don’t agree with this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, you should not use the sites and services. If you have any questions please contact us at support@convexmind.io.
</p>

<h3>Advertisements</h3>
<p>There are no third-party ads in our apps. The only third party service providers we use in our apps are to support our internal operations and we do not collect anything that is personally identifiable in our apps for children.
    <br>We may collect your game progress, time spent playing, touch interactions, and achievements. This information is for us to help us improve our services for you. We do not share this information with anyone other than you in the form of recommended activities based on your child’s gameplay.
    <br>If you have any questions about our collection and use please contact us at support@convexmind.io.
</p>

<h3>General Privacy</h3>
<p>What Information We Collect From You
    <br>We collect your email & password in order for you to have an account on our server and log back in to gather your data. We do not share this data with anyone else. It is used purely for a login to grab a secure token and that’s it.
</p>

<h3>What Kind of Information is Collected From Your Child?</h3>
<p>We collect touch data on your child based on the choices we present them.
    <br>This information is tied to the parent’s account and used to present progress and their child’s interests to the parent.  It may also used anonymously in-aggregate to establish how a parent’s child is doing compared to the others of a similar group. 
</p>

<h3>Data Types</h3>
<p>There are two types of data that may be collected. The first one is called personal data. This is personally identifiable information that identifies a user as an individual. ConvexMind may collect personal data that parents voluntarily provide on the website. The second type is non personal data which doesn’t directly identify an individual or which may have been personal information but has had the personally identifiable information removed. ConvexMind may collect non personal information about the use of the website and apps to help us improve our services.
</p>

<h3>More About Personal Data</h3>
<p>We collect personal data when a parent makes a purchase through our online store, subscribes to a newsletter or alert, submits content to a forum or blog, or requests technical support. This data may include a name (screen or nickname), gender, birth date, email address, mailing or shipping address, telephone number, and payment information. This information may be used to provide services and the sites to you, to process and fulfill your orders, to contact parents about their orders and new services and features and to send push notifications if consent to receive them has been given. If you contact us for help we will only use your email address to reply to your question. Please note that if a parent posts personal information about themselves in a community forum or blog in the parent section, in addition to being collected, this data is made public for others to see. The parent is responsible for the disclosure of any such data in those forums. More about Non Personal Data
    <br>We may use cookies and web beacons to help deliver and analyze our services (e.g., by counting the number of times a page or advert has been viewed).
    <br>ConvexMind may also use third parties from time to time to deliver a service to parents only, such as payment processing, sending emails, infrastructure and IT services, or helping with customer or technical support. We only work with companies that follow this privacy policy and agree not to use your information for any other purposes. If you’d like more information on this, please contact us at support@convexmind.io.
</p>

<h3>A Word About What We Might Disclose</h3>
<p>As you can see, we collect minimal personal data, and some nonpersonal data for internal use only or in conjunction with third parties to help us operate, analyze, and improve our sites and services. In addition, we may disclose your personal or nonpersonal information to additional parties if we believe we are required to by law, by a judicial proceeding, to protect ConvexMind’s rights and properties, or to investigate fraud, intellectual property infringement, and any other conduct that might be illegal or expose ConvexMind or a user of its services to legal liability. In addition, ConvexMind may disclose information collected from a parent in the event of a change or proposed change in the ownership of the company; for example, a sale, a merger, or bankruptcy.
    <br>Parents may disclose information about themselves by posting in the public forums on the site. ConvexMind is not responsible for what parents say and post in these sections.
</p>

<h3>Tracking</h3>
<p>We use Google Analytics Advertising Features to better understand the use of our website for parents. These features include Remarketing, Impression reporting, integration with DoubleClick and Demographic & Interest reporting. They use cookies and anonymous identifiers to collect information and help target advertising. We do not combine this information with any personally identifiable information you may have submitted when signing up to a newsletter for example. Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals; but, you can opt out of Google Analytics by visiting: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
    <br>You can also configure your browser to accept or reject cookies. All browsers are different so go to the help section of your browser to find out how to do this.
</p>

<h3>Links</h3>
<p>We may include links to third parties to parents as part of our recommended activities service. ConvexMind isn’t responsible for these companies and including a link to them doesn’t mean that ConvexMind endorses them. So be sure to check their privacy policies if you decide to visit them. And remember, your use of ConvexMind’s sites and services may also be subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of other services that ConvexMind doesn’t control such as mobile application stores, mobile software platforms, online social media sites, or payment processors.
</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>ConvexMind uses generally accepted security measures and safeguards in an attempt to keep the data it collects secure and requires that the third parties it works with agree to do the same. The measures and safeguards include limiting access to the data to those persons who need it to complete their work for ConvexMind, using secure token based transactions, and storing personal information in secure operating environments. That said, ConvexMind cannot and does not guarantee and does not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
</p>

<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>There are two types of data we retain: parent data & child data. Parent data is data used to login to our app by the parent or legal guardian of the child using the app. This data can be removed by contacting support@convexmind.io.  
Child data is game progress data associated with the child’s account under the parent’s account. This data can be deleted from the app by the parent. After deletion, child data will be anonymized and moved to our aggregate statistic database within a reasonable timeframe.
</p>

<h3>How to Update or Remove Your Information</h3>
<p>ConvexMind keeps your content for as long as necessary in providing its services. If you want to opt out of services, or review or delete your information, please contact us at support@convexmind.io.
